# The Archonic Handbook
## First Edition

### Basic Checklist
Is the design flat?

Is the main part of your design centered?

Is all your text easy to read?

Are there no generated shadows?

Is your color scheme clear?

Is your design simple?  

Are your layers 2D?

Can your design be static?

Are your fonts established?

### Principles
The basic principles of Archonic are:

Flat- Anything that is remotely Archonic must be flat!  Simplicity is elegance.

Centered- If your style isn’t centered, so be it.  However, Archonic looks best centered, so I suggest that you center at least the main elements (logos, ect).

### Rulebook
This is the strict rulebook for Archonic.  If you want your design to be fully Archonic, then check this out.  If you’re not a designer, please don’t even read this.  You won’t understand it.
