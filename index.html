      <h3>Hello.</h3>
      <p>I'm Micah, and <a target="
        " href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/-Archon-/">@-Archon-</a> is my account on Scratch. I'm a graphic designer and web developer. Scratch has always been my home, as I started programming there when I was twelve. -Archon- is
        not my first account on Scratch, but
        it'll probably be my last.<br><br>Right now, I'm building a Scratch application for Android mobile devices, and you can check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/386321275/">latest development update</a> or the <a
          target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Scratch-Client-4/mobile">GitHub
          repository</a> to learn more. I'm also a
        judge in <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/UI-Wars/">UI Wars One</a>, a design
        competition started by <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Aquarial/">@Aquarial</a>.<br><br>Currently, logo and branding requests are closed. Please don't ask me to make you a logo <em>anywhere</em> on Scratch, as I'm too
        busy to handle them. Thanks a lot! <br><br>:D</p>
