      <p>I'm Micah, and <a target="
        " href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/-Archon-/">@-Archon-</a> is my account on Scratch. I'm a graphic designer and web developer. Scratch has always been my home, as I started programming there when I was twelve. @-Archon- is
        not my first account on Scratch, but it'll probably be my last.<br><br>Right now, I'm a judge in <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/UI-Wars/">UI Wars One</a>, a design
        competition started by <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Aquarial/">@Aquarial</a>. I'm also the founder and editor-in-chief of <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TheInformant">@TheInformant</a>, an
        online news source for Scratch. You can read Informant articles and submit stories <a target="_blank" href="https://informant.micahlindley.com/">here</a>. As well, I'm working on a physics-based game called Zipline, but it's currently in
        early alpha and might not even come out.<br><br>Currently, logo and branding requests are closed. Please don't ask me to make
        you a logo <em>anywhere</em> on Scratch, as I'm too
        busy to handle them. Thanks a lot!</p>
